  "execution": "<round execution strategy>",
  "post_plant_or_retake": "<strategy for either defending the spike post-plant or retaking it>"

1) Always return all three fields.
2) If some user info is missing, output "N/A" for that part while keeping the field present.
3) Keep strategies concise, tactical, and in professional team callout style.
